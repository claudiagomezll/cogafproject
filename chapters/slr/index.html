                    <p class="pb-5">This systematic review was conducted using a methodology inspired by the PRISMA (Preferred 
                        Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology. In this SLR were identified 
                        three research questions to learn how SGs facilitate immediate feedback, brain stimulation, and 
                        at-risk training. The outcome was the selection of 30 publications following a three-phase 
                        process: 1) A search string based on three research questions was defined and applied to some 
                        databases. 2) Publications were filtered by title and abstract. 3) A full-text reading was conducted 
                        for selecting relevant publications. The results of this SLR showed SG development methodologies 
                        with guided development processes that can be applied to any case study. In addition, it was found 
                        that Virtual Reality (VR), despite its implementation costs, is the most used technology for safety 
                        training, inspection, and operation of heavy machinery. Conclusions obtained from this SLR are the 
                        following:1) Modeling languages (e.g., GML, UML) and metamodeling are important in SG development. 2) 
                        SG is a significant mechanism for cooperative and participative learning strategies. 3) Virtual Reality 
                        (VR) technology is widely used in safe virtual environments for mining training. 4) There is a need 
                        for methodologies that integrate the specification of cognitive functions with the affective part of 
                        the users for SGs suitable for learning environments.</p>
